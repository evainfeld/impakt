						<p>How can grassroots causes compete with big money campaigns that play dirty? If the Cambridge Analyticas of this world can deliver targeted, manipulative messages to millions, how can we fight them? And can we compete without compromising our ethics and violating GDPR ourselves?</br></br>
	
	By helping our supporters convince their friends based on what they themselves know about them. We're not collecting any of this data, and we're open about the process. 	We also help supporters find each other based on location, and get involved in campaigning together. We have end-to-end encrypted messaging in-app, as well as an ephemeral, open local chat. We have panic buttons and other safety measures, as well as a way to contact the nearest coordinator with a single push of a button.

				<p align="justify">Jenny is a young progressive in a small town. She's shy and fears going to a meeting in a nearby city with politically motivated strangers. But she would like to find a way to help a progressive political party.</p>
				<p style="font-size:19px">WITH IMPAKT, SHE CAN DOWNLOAD THE APP AND IMMEDIATELY GET INVOLVED.</br></p>
				<p align="justify">When Jenny downloaded <i>Impakt</i>, she met others like her thanks to the <i>local chat</i>, including several people in her home town. They got together and started brainstorming about what they could do locally. Jenny also used the <i>contact nearest coordinator</i> button to get in touch with party structures and got some logistics help from Matt, the regional coordinator for her area.</p>

				<p align="justify">Greg works on a construction site. He knows that there are many intermediaries between the laborers and the site owner each get a large cut of the money. He thinks the workers could get a fair shake by organising to negotiate their wages, or forming a co-op to be employed directly. But the frequent rotation of workers from site to site makes it difficult to gather numbers.</p>
				<p style="font-size:19px">IMPAKT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR TEMPORARY WORKERS AND GIG ECONOMY WORKERS TO ORGANISE.</br></p>
				<p align="justify"> Using <i>Impakt</i>, construction workers in the entire country could self-organise regardless of what site they currently work at. They could coordinate events, vote and raise money. As an admin, Greg can also send alerts to anyone in an area for spontaneous gatherings.</p>

				<p style="font-size:19px">NO ONE CAN TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS BETTER THAN YOU. WE HELP YOU MAKE THE BEST ARGUMENT TO CONVINCE THEM, WITHOUT GATHERING ANY DATA.</br></p>
				<p align="justify">Using <i>Impakt</i>, Tracy had access to current information and press releases of the union, and reached out to many of her friends. She had relevant information for parents of school-age kids, other public-sector workers and so on. The sharing process was easy and personalised. And the best thing of all - <i>Impakt</i> did not collect any data! Tracy had complete control over the whole process.</p>

				He was relieved when Greg explained to him that <i>Impakt</i> has <i>domain fronting</i> - that is, the network operator can't see that you're connecting to it.</p>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="text-uppercase">So even if Pete uses the work wifi, the bossess won't know that he's supporting the movement.
				Also, the server doesn't store identifying information, and Pete never had to so much as give his real name.

				<p align="justify">Agnieszka lives in a country with mid-level surveillance capabilities and has concerns about rapidly diminishing civil liberties. She would like to get people involved in direct action, but has concerns about repercussions.
				</br></br>She decided to use <i>Impakt</i> to coordinate, because the app is <i>stateless</i> - if anyone's phone gets seized the app will not show what they have been doing in it. She also likes the fact that all chats are <i>ephemeral</i> - the contents dissapear after a short time. No personal data is being collected by the <i>Impakt</i> server. On any Impakt screen, one can trace two circles to activate a <i>panic alert</i> and notify other members of the movement that they need help. This is the only time that the Impakt app uses a device's location.</p>
