	By helping our supporters convince their friends based on what they themselves know about them. We're not collecting any of this data, and we're open about the process. 	We also help supporters find each other based on location, and get involved in campaigning together. We have end-to-end encrypted messaging in-app, as well as an ephemeral, open local chat. We have panic buttons and other safety measures, as well as a way to contact the nearest coordinator with a single push of a button.

					<h1 class="text-uppercase">AGENCY: JENNY, A SUPPORTER</h1>
					<p > Jenny is a young progressive in a small town. She doesn't know any other progressives and feels isolated. She's shy and going to a meeting in a nearby city with politically motivated strangers scares her, but she would like to find a way to help a cause.</br></br>

When Jenny downloaded <i>ChangeAgent</i>, she met others in a similar situation thanks to the <i>local chat</i>. It turned out there are several people in her town who would also like to help a progressive cause. They got together and started brainstorming about what they could do for their town. Jenny also used the <i>contact nearest coordinator</i> button on ChangeAgent to get in touch with existing structures and got some logistics help from Matt, the regional coordinator for the area.</p>

					<img src="img/greg.png" width="75%" alt="" title="">
					<h1 class="text-uppercase">CONVENIENCE: GREG, A LABOR ORGANISER</h1>
					<p>Greg is working on a construction site. He knows there are many levels of intermediaries between the laborers and the site owner, who each get a cut. The frequent rotation of workers from site to site makes it difficult to organise and demand better wages and hours. If only the workers had a structure that would help them negotiate directly with the building developer they could get far better wages and working conditions by cutting out intermediaries.</br></br>
With a <i>ChangeAgent</i> instance, construction workers in the entire country could self-organise regardless of what site they currently work at. Greg is especially happy about the fact that <i>ChangeAgent</i> makes it easy to organise events, vote and raise money. As an admin, he can also send alerts to anyone in an area for spontaneous gatherings.</p>

					<h1 class="text-uppercase">COMMUNITY: TRACY, AN ISOLATED TEACHER</h1>
					<p>Tracy is a small town teacher. She is planning on joining an upcoming nationwide teachers' strike but she fears that her community would not support her. 

</br></br>
With the help of <i>ChangeAgent</i>, she was able to quickly send messages to many of her friends, with a great chance of convincing them to support the strike. Parents of school-age kids got messages about how the strike will bolster the quality of education, other public-sector workers got messages of solidarity about working conditions and salaries and those who Tracy knew to be motivated by opposing the government were alerted to the teachers' struggle. And the best thing of all - <i>ChangeAgent</i> did not collect any of this data! Tracy had complete control over the whole process.</p>

					<h1 class="text-uppercase">SECURITY: AGNIESZKA, AN ACTIVIST</h1>
					<p>Agnieszka lives in a country with mid-level surveillance capabilities and has concerns about rapidly diminishing civil liberties. She would like to get people involved in direct action, but has concerns about repercussions. </br></br>She decided to use <i>ChangeAgent</i> to coordinate, because the app is <i>stateless</i> - if anyone's phone gets seized the app will not show what they have been doing in it. She also likes the fact that all chats are <i>ephemeral</i> - the contents dissapear after a short time, and that no personal data is being collected by the <i>ChangeAgent</i> server. The app also has a <i>panic button</i>, in case any of the participants finds themselves in physical danger.</p>

					<h1 class="text-uppercase">PRIVACY: pete, a worker who'd rather stay anonymous </h1>
					<p>Pete works with Greg at the construction site, and he thinks Greg has a lot of great ideas. But he has a family to feed and doesn't want to make waves with the bosses. </br></br>He was relieved when Greg explained to him that ChangeAgent has <i>domain fronting</i> - that is, the network operator can't see that you're connecting to it. So even if Pete accidentally connects in the work wifi, the bossess won't know that he's supporting the movement.</p>
