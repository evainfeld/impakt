						<p>How can grassroots causes compete with big money campaigns that play dirty? If the Cambridge Analyticas of this world can deliver targeted, manipulative messages to millions, how can we fight them? And can we compete without compromising our ethics and violating GDPR ourselves?</br></br>
	
	By helping our supporters convince their friends based on what they themselves know about them. We're not collecting any of this data, and we're open about the process. 	We also help supporters find each other based on location, and get involved in campaigning together. We have end-to-end encrypted messaging in-app, as well as an ephemeral, open local chat. We have panic buttons and other safety measures, as well as a way to contact the nearest coordinator with a single push of a button.

				<p align="justify">Jenny is a young progressive in a small town. She's shy and going to a meeting in a nearby city with politically motivated strangers scares her, but she would like to find a way to help a progressive political party.</p>
				</div>	
				<div class="col-md-7 text-center">
					<p align="justify">When she downloaded <i>Impakt</i>, she met others like her thanks to the <i>local chat</i>, including several people in her home town. They got together and started brainstorming about what they could do locally. Jenny also used the <i>contact nearest coordinator</i> button to get in touch with party structures and got some logistics help from Matt, the regional coordinator for her area.</p>

				</div>	
				<div class="col-md-7 text-center">
					<p align="justify">The frequent rotation of workers from site to site makes it difficult to organise a union. But using <i>Impakt</i>, construction workers in the entire country could self-organise regardless of what site they currently work at. Through <i>Impakt</i> they could coordinate events, vote and raise money. As an admin, Greg can also send alerts to anyone in an area for spontaneous gatherings.</p>

					<p align="justify">Using <i>Impakt</i>, she sent messages to many of her friends to convince them to support the strike. Parents of school-age kids got messages about how the strike will bolster the quality of education, other public-sector workers got heard about working conditions and salaries and so on. And the best thing of all - <i>Impakt</i> did not collect any data! Tracy had complete control over the whole process.</p>

				<div class="col-md-7 text-center">
					<p align="justify">He was relieved when Greg explained to him that <i>Impakt</i> has <i>domain fronting</i> - that is, the network operator can't see that you're connecting to it.

				<div class="col-md-7 text-center">
					<p align="justify">She decided to use <i>Impakt</i> to coordinate, because the app is <i>stateless</i> - if anyone's phone gets seized the app will not show what they have been doing in it. She also likes the fact that all chats are <i>ephemeral</i> - the contents dissapear after a short time. No personal data is being collected by the <i>Impakt</i> server. The app's <i>panic button</i>, may come in handy in case anyone finds themselves in physical danger.</p>
